      Notes to Grader: 
      <br>
      - I've readjusted the way the color sliders worked from the Youtube playlist code such that it 
      accurately reflects the sliders. For example, if you had set the red slider to about 10, the
      color would appear teal. This was due to the fact that the values were initally set to white
      which was [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], such that if the red slider was used, it would set the color
      to [0.1, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] which would result teal. To avoid this problem and get the expected
      color, I ensured that if a slider was used, the other colors would be set to 0.0 unless
      they were also adjusted.
      <br>
      - The triangles in the Youtube playlist were coded as right triangles, but I modified them to
      be equilateral triangles that are in the sample in the assigment. Plus I think they look better.
      <br>
      - I added a color picker that also adjusts the sliders to match the selected color.
      <br>
      - I added a way to enable and disable a vertical line of symmetry by using a HTML checkbox. This
      allows the user to create unqiue symmetric drawings. I simply had to create a copy of the drawn
      point with the x-coordinate negated. 
      <br>
      - My proudest addition is the zoom feature. By using the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in and out
      of the center of the canvas. By adding an event listener for the vertical mouse scroll and creating a function to 
      account for zoom speed and level, I was able to apply the zoom level to x and y coordinates of all 
      shapes drawn on the canvas. This includes points, triangles, circles. Though I did notice a the points
      scaled differently than the triangles and circles, likely due to the way points are rendered with drawArrays. If I 
      hade more time, I would like to have a a zoom in with focal preseveration, such that the origin is at the cursor
      as opposed to the center of the canvas.

      - The image I made has the initals "RV" in the clouds.
