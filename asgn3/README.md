The Minecraft assets I grabbed were from https://mcasset.cloud/1.21.11/assets/minecraft/textures which provide 128x128 textures for blocks in the game. The youtube tutorials and textbook provided enough help to complete the requierments. Most difficult was the smooth movement and camera but some debugging and several hours of reviewing material it wasn't too hard to implement. Much like the previous assignments, the Github Copilot helped autofill some tedious bits of code (such as the textures and camera elements).

When sprinting with shift, to give a better sense of speed aside from increasing the camera speed, I also increase the FOV much like sprinting in actual Minecraft. I've also included 6 blocks to play with when building. Most of the textures look exactly like their reference but the grass block texture was actually originally gray. By mixing a color vec4 with the texture, I was able to replicate the color of grass typically found in the spruce biomes in Minecraft. The wood around the world reflects the spruce biome, such as the wood planks and planks which use the spruce wood texture.

I was somewhat able to figure out how to save builds by simply copying the g_placedBlocks array I have and running a loop to re-render but due to time I simply just created a house saved it in a seperate savedMap file and allowed the user to generate that prebuilt shelter.
